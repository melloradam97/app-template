# My FastTrack Project Template ðŸš€

Welcome to my custom project template! Designed to jumpstart my projects, I've carefully chosen core and supplementary technologies to ensure speed, efficiency, and top-notch user experience.

## Core Technologies ðŸ› 

- **Next.js**: A React framework best known for its hybrid static & server rendering.
- **Blitz.js**: The Fullstack React Framework built on Next.js.
- **TypeScript**: Provides static type definitions to make our code more readable and maintainable.
- **Prisma**: An open-source database toolkit.
- **Zod**: A library for TypeScript runtime validation.
- **Mantine UI**: A modern React component library. *Note*: Planning to switch to **Tailwind** due to dev experience preferences.

## Supplementary Technologies ðŸ’¼

- **Nodemailer**: An efficient way to send emails from our applications to view locally.
- **UploadThing**: A super easy file upload library for React.
- **Resend**: A library for sending emails.
- **React-Email**: A library for building responsive HTML emails.

## Current Progress ðŸŒ±

This is a work in progress. I will be continuously updating as I make progress.

## Future Plans âœ¨

Considering the potential utility for others, I might evolve this into a full-fledged template.
